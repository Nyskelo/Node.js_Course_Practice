# Node.js_Course_Practice

The Node.js project API is build with basic CRUD functionalities, using the Express.js framework and the MongoDB database, with Swagger documentation and TypeScript safety. It runs using Nodemon.

The Mongoose library is used to connect the application to the MongoDB database.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [jest](https://ghub.io/jest).

## Code Coverage Functionality

To generate and include a code coverage report as part of your test results run `npm run test:coverage` which will run the project's unit tests with Jest and produce documentation that gives guidance on how well the project's tests cover the code.

The documentation is created inside the `/coverage` folder (ignored by git).
